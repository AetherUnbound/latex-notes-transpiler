On Effective Field Theory in Cosmology - Leonardo Senatore (Stanford)
    identifying signatures of inflation (of the universe)
    2 parts of physics - discovering not-yet-known physics, and building simple models/understanding for complex/collective phenomena
    status of high energy physics
        can't put quantum + general relativity at high energies
        what controls hierarchy between planck scale and cosmological constant
    trying to look into the cosmological past is like trying to look at a cloud - we can only see the photons that come from the last reflection
    basic picture of big bang
        universe was hot, then cooled down
        past universe was very simple, complex structures formed later
    cosmology reveals itself in the land of high energy physics
        it is also an encompassing field, needs numerous cooperating fields

    Effective field theory in inflation
        universe is very homogeneous
        in inflation, the source of galaxies are quantum effects (quantum changes evolve into macroscopic objects)
        in the typical background radiation picture, the fluctuations are 
            primordial
            scale invariant
            quite gaussian
        we need a description that links inflation to these fluctuations
        the fluctuations are much lower energy scale than the background radiation, so we can throw them out
        field/wavefunction does *not* have to take the form of the harmonic oscillator
        these wavefunctions can have a high degree of self interactions
        How did inflation start?
            inflation is a "fundamental scalar field"
            FRW - evolution with normal matter
                closed universe: collapses
                open universe: expands forever
            evolution in completely inhomogenous universe leads to singularities - difficult to describe
            we can show that most 3-manifolds cannot globally collapse (i.e. inflation will occur somewhere)
            lots of math to show that some regions of the universe keep expanding, regardless of singularities
            therefore, since you can't have a completely maximally expanding surface, inflation somewhere in the universe will always occur
            numerical simulations show that inflation will start even with singularities
            inflation gives a universe a finite probability to become an infinite volume
        Summary
            developed a generalized model that matches all cosmological observation
            allows exploration of interesting phenomonolegy of inflation
    Comparison to condensed matter physics
        for small "boxes", there are huge fluctuations in matter in the universe
        for larger "boxes", the fluctuations are much smaller, universe becomes much more homogenous
        the universe looks like a dielectric
        on distances larger than 10Mpc, dark matter can be modelled like an effective fluid-like system
