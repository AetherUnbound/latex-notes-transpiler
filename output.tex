\subsection*{On Effective Field Theory in Cosmology - Leonardo Senatore (Stanford)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identifying signatures of inflation (of the universe)
		\item 2 parts of physics - discovering not-yet-known physics, and building simple models/understanding for complex/collective phenomena
		\item Status of high energy physics
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can't put quantum + general relativity at high energies
			\item What controls hierarchy between planck scale and cosmological constant
		\end{itemize}
		\item Trying to look into the cosmological past is like trying to look at a cloud - we can only see the photons that come from the last reflection
		\item Basic picture of big bang
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Universe was hot, then cooled down
			\item Past universe was very simple, complex structures formed later
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
