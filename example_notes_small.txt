On Effective Field Theory in Cosmology - Leonardo Senatore (Stanford)
    identifying signatures of inflation (of the universe)
    2 parts of physics - discovering not-yet-known physics, and building simple models/understanding for complex/collective phenomena
    status of high energy physics
        can't put quantum + general relativity at high energies
        what controls hierarchy between planck scale and cosmological constant



    trying to look into the cosmological past is like trying to look at a cloud - we can only see the photons that come from the last reflection
    basic picture of big bang
        universe was hot, then cooled down
        past universe was very simple, complex structures formed later
